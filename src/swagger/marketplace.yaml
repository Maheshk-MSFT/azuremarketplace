      summary: Resolve a subscription
      description: >-
        The resolve endpoint enables the publisher to resolve a marketplace token to a persistent resource ID. The resource ID is the unique identifier for a SaaS subscription. When a user is redirected to a partner's website, the URL contains a token in the query parameters. The partner is expected to use this token and make a request to resolve it. The response contains the unique SaaS subscription ID, name, offer ID, and plan for the resource. This token is valid for one hour only.
